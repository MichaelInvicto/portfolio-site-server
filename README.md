# portfolio-site-server

Due to the fact that github only deploys the client side of websites, if you have a server it's not going to work.

On my portfolio website, I have a contact me form that is supposed to send me an email, and for now, I'd like to host it on github. Given my options, the only thing I can do is to host the server code somewhere else (in this case heroku) and then host the client here.
